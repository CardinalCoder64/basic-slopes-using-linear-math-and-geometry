# basic-slopes-using-linear-math-and-geometry
These are the project files for the tutorial, "Guide to Basic Slopes Using Linear Math and Geometry (Object-Oriented, Top-Down)". These projects also include code from my "Pixel-Perfect Object-Based Collision (PPOBC)" tutorial.

These projects are to help people who want to base their project off the code or just want a hands-on example of how the code works.

**This code will NOT work for 2D platformers. Future updates may change this.**

Instructions:
- Download .zip file
- There are two project types: "No Lines", and "With Lines". These refer to the lines of the slope(s) when the player collides with them.
- Open either project using GameMaker (2022.1+).
- Run the project or view/edit the code if desired.

You're welcome to use these project files as a basis for your game. You may also copy/paste the code into an existing project.
